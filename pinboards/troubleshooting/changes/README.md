Admins frequently get complaints like "My application was working fine yesterday, but today it is very slow or not working at all".
Intentional/Unintentional changes carried out to configuration, changes in usage pattern etc. are very frequently responsible for such issues.
vRNI is awesome when it comes to keeping track of configuration changes over a period of time.
In fact, vRNI tracks the changes for a month at the very least.
But this information is overwhelming and requires some vRNI know-how to use.
The dashboards in this section make it easy for the admins to view important changes for specific areas.
